// The `Polygon` message represents a closed geometric shape on a map.

// with the first and last points also connected to form a closed shape.
// This structure is commonly used in mapping applications, GIS, and geofencing.

  //
  // Example: A triangle may have three points:
  // - Point 1: `x=0, y=0`
  // - Point 2: `x=10, y=0`
  // - Point 3: `x=5, y=5`
  // The first point is automatically connected to the last point to close the shape.
